Slack Slack is a popular messaging platform. When you become a lab member youll receive an invitation to the IRSS Slack channel. Follow up with Nicholas if you havent yet. The IRSS Slack portal ID is ubc-irss.slack.com IRSS Slack contains several channels, each serving different purposes. The most important channels are: #general - For general discussion on various topics. #ncc_annouce - For important announcements, typically only Nicholas will post in this channel. #science - Anything science related, can be an interesting paper or a coding issue someone is struggling with. #irss-supp-grp - Lab support group. A place to anonymously share ideas of how to improve the lab, talk about issues not related to your research, or ask for help. Important to note that Nicholas is not a member of this channel. Youll quickly notice that the conversations on Slack (especially on #general) are often very relaxed. However, remember that all public channels are PG-13. Email Nicholass primary email is nicholas.coops@ubc.ca. He generally tries to respond to emails as quickly as possible, but if he hasnt replied to you in 2 days, send him a reminder.
