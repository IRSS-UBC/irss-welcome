# Working in the lab or from home {-#working}

The lab  has an alarm system that must be engaged at the end of the day by the last person out, and disengaged by the first person in. Its important to know how to use the alarm system. See the video `\\FRST-IRSStor\Root\ByProject\Orientation\Orientation_Videos\Alarm_Demo.mp4` to familiarize yourself.

Students are encouraged to be active members by coming into UBC each day. Students should limit spending large amounts of time working from home - with caveats related to illness. COVID-19 has changed how people work, and we appreciate that everyone has different working styles. Some students wishing to arrive early and leave early, while others may choose to arrive late and work late. Nicholas considers the hours between 10 - 2 pm as being critical hours that everyone is reachable and working.

We appreciate that you may wish to take a day off occasionally during the week to reward yourself for a job well done or simply to enjoy outdoor activities without the rush of the weekend. You are welcome to do so as long as you recognize generally that that time would need to be made up, either through working on a weekend or extra hours during the week. For example, members of the lab have been known to take long weekends during the winter for skiing where they then make up the time lost by working a day on the following weekend.

[Dogs are allowed in the forestry building with documentation and approval](https://safety.forestry.ubc.ca/dogs-in-the-workplace/). If you have a dog and are interested in bringing them in, you will need to apply through [Joanne Dean](https://frm.forestry.ubc.ca/people/staff/) from the FRM office at `joanne.Dean@ubc.ca`.

The application involves basic information regarding the dog, as well as written _approval from fellow lab members using a consent form_. Once you have applied, you and the dog will be interviewed by Joanne. Provided there are no behavioral concerns, your dog will be issued a green collar to be worn in the lab, as well as a sign to say that there are dogs in the work place. It is important to note that while dogs are allowed, appropriate training is important. Too many dogs at once can be distracting, so a limit of 3 dogs across the IRSS rooms is enforced. Therefore, it's important to coordinate with other dog owners in the lab.
