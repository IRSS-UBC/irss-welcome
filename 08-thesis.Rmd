# Your thesis {-#thesis}

Below you will find descriptive text and links to some orientation videos to provide more context for the key requirements new students need to think about in their first year. These videos are intended for you as a reference, but if you want more clarification or have other questions be sure to ask. Click on the videos below or find them in the `\\FRST-IRSStor\Root\ByProject\Orientation\Orientation_Videos` folder. Other helpful resources on writing can be found at `\\FRST-IRSStor\Root\ByProject\__LABFORMS\Scientific writing`.

## Important resources for writing your thesis {-#thesiswriting}

Within the first few months of starting your degree, you’ll need to write a mini proposal, which will be sent to potential committee members. The mini proposal will then be enhanced into a full proposal after getting feedback from your committee during your first committee meeting.


### Developing a mini proposal {-#proposal}

<p align="center">
[![Developing a mini proposal](http://img.youtube.com/vi/CjQuJqhK1z8/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/CjQuJqhK1z8 "Developing a mini proposal")
</p>

* You'll likely get the first comments back about your writing from Nicholas. They may come across quite strongly (perhaps even brash) - don’t take it personally, this is a learning curve for most new grad students, and Nicholas just tries to be clear and concise.

* After your mini-proposal is sent to your committee, you will need to have your first committee meeting.

### Establishing and preparing for your first committee meeting {-#committee}

</p>

* Nicholas will help you to find potential committee members.

* Committee meetings happen once per year, with your first meeting ideally 6 months after you start.

* Committee meeting forms can be found in `\\FRST-IRSStor\Root\ByProject\__LABFORMS\Ctee-Mtg-Forms`.


### Adaptation of the mini proposal to a full proposal after that first committee meeting {-#fullproposal}

</p>

* Use feedback from your first committee meeting.

* Every section will become more detailed and expanded.

* From 8 — 20 for MSc; 30 for PhD.

* Update your timeline and plans based on progress to date.

* Text is used in the development of the bookends in the final thesis.

### Writing a literature review {-#litreview}

Details about the publication process including:

* Thoughts to consider before starting to write

* How to write effective science

* Things to know about the publication process

* The importance of peer-review

### Thoughts around TAing {-#TAing}
In addition to working on their thesis, some students also decide to become teaching assistants for undergraduate and graduate classes. Here are some things to consider about TAing.

<p align="center">
[![Thoughts around TAing](http://img.youtube.com/vi/kGIcUW2YS0c/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/kGIcUW2YS0c "Thoughts around TAing")
</p>


* TAing looks great on your resume and can help to expose you to new ideas and learn different software. 

* TAing does not replace research, it is done in addition to your research.

### The last 3 months of your program {-#finishing}
The last few months of your program can be hectic. A lot of things can be happening at once, so its important to know what to expect!

* Getting ready to defend your thesis.

* Timetable and considerations during your last months prior to defense.

* Transforming papers to a submitted thesis.

* Committee feedback and selecting examiners.

## Thesis structure {-#thesisstructure}

Your thesis is the most important document that you will produce in your time in the lab. Below you will find the general structure and main components of the thesis, as well as links to the graduate studies website and previous theses.

## Completion timeline {-#completion}

Funding availability is the primary driver of your completion timeline. This can vary from student to student so it's important to talk with Nicholas about your funding situation. MSc students typically get two years of funding; the goal is to complete your degree in that time, but this is not a ‘hard’ rule. Around the two year mark, Nicholas will have a conversation about when you are going to finish. If it takes you an extra month or two Nicholas will continue paying your stipend, given you have shown consistent efforts to finish. PhD students get four years of funding. The goal is to complete your comprehensive exam before you finish your second year, and defend in your fourth year. Again, Nicholas will likely have a conversation with you when you get close to the fourth year mark.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%",fig.align = 'center',fig.cap="Agatha immediately after her recent successful defence. Congrats, Agatha!"}
knitr::include_graphics("img\\completion1.jpg")
```

## Publishing {-#publishing}

Nicholas encourages you to write academic papers about the components of your thesis project - these will basically become your thesis chapters (& parts of other sections). The goal is 2 for MSc and 4 for PhD. 

More often than not students defend before they have published their 2nd or 4th paper. Nicholas addresses writing papers in the mini-proposal and mini-to-full proposal videos.

## Conferences {-#conferences}

Nicholas typically funds 1 conference for MSc students and 2 conferences for PhD students. Examples include:

* [Canadian Remote Sensing Symposium - vast topics in remote sensing research across Canada (located in various cities across Canada)](https://crss-sct.ca/) 

* [ForestSAT - spatial analysis and remote sensing technologies for forest monitoring, modeling & description (international)](https://www.forestsat.com/)

* [Silvilaser - LiDAR focused (international)](https://silvilaser2021.at/)

* [WHISPERS - Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (international)](https://www.ieee-whispers.com/)

These conferences are a great opportunity to meet other scientists in your field, learn about their work, present your own, and make opportunities for collaboration.

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%",fig.align = 'center',fig.cap="Annie speaking about her work at the Remote Sensing for Forest Practitioners workshop in Edmonton."}
knitr::include_graphics("img\\conference2.jpg")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%",fig.align = 'center',fig.cap="Sights to see at different conferences - Foz de Iguazu, Silvilaser 2019."}
knitr::include_graphics("img\\conference1.jpg")
```

During these conferences, you are typically eligible for a per diem (up to $60 USD per day). You should track the days you are away and submit an expense report to get reimbursed. To do so, visit the [workday portal](https://hr.ubc.ca/working-ubc/welcome-workday). From there, click on 'Expenses' in the main menu, and submit a report. If you have any other questions, you can email [Gladys Tecson](https://frm.forestry.ubc.ca/people/staff/) (`gladys.tecson@ubc.ca`). It takes a little while to be processed, but you will be reimbursed.
